/**
 * <p>IS: An application that can convert any data file into a file writer
 * class which contains a method to recreate the data file during unit testing.
 * The application is run as follows:
 * java org.jax.mgi.shr.unitTest.DataFileClassCreator <input filename> <output classname> [package name].
 * The input file is the data file to be used. The output file is the java source file
 * the application will create and the package is the name of the package the
 * compiled class will belong to. This newly created source file is compiled and then
 * the resulting class is subsequently used in a unit test program for recreating the
 * data file on the fly.
 * <p>HAS: an input file</p>
 * <p>DOES: creates a java source file for compiling into a class that can
 * recreate the input file on demand.
